# GUICopier
This is a File copy mechanism like windows copy with a GUI written in Swing Worker and File I/O of Java. This was my Graduation mini-project. The input and output directories needs to be hardcoded. 
This repository contains the netbeans project.
There is also a Executable JAR in the dist folder.
